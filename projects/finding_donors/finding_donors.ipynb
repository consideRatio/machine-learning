    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "I choose SVM, SGDC and Gradient boosting in order to learn a set of somewhat complementary tools that I found interesting. I chose SVM as I understand them to be applied quite generally, for example [4] recommends using them with datasets less than 100k entries. For larger datasets SGDC is recommended [4], and I like that you could, as far as i understand it, utilize SGDC for incremental learning, and that might be very relevant for a personal use case I have in mind. And finally I choose gradient boosting since I was enthralled by how similar the train/test learning curves behaves with a growing sum of weak learner contributions.\n",

    "I read about a SVM-classifier being implemented to improve the behaviour of an industry robot in the situations some error had arisen. It was meant to improve the current too simple behaviour of first letting go of any held parts in a scrap station and then returning to a home position. They wanted the SVM-classifier to decide if it should do one of four things instead: 1) go home, 2) scrap a held part and then go home, 3) drop a held part and then go home, and 4) stop and wait for human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features used in order to decide on the error recovery behaviour was in summary: location, gripping tool status, and procedure status. The feature space contained 432 combinations, and the goal was to show the robot as few examples as possible in order of a preferred error recovery behaviour (1-4) in that feature space, and let the SVM generalize from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "They key to reach 100% accuracy, which was plausible in this case, in as short time as possible was said to be choosing good training examples. With cleverly chosen training examples they could achieve 100% accuracy after training on 1/16 of the feature space compared to about 1/4 of the feature space.\n",

    "## 3: Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is commonly used together with decision trees (GBDT), so is the Random forest (RF) technique. Both techniques are combining simpler decision trees in order to form a better hypothesis. Scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting can only utilize decision tree's as weak learners as far as I understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Described use case **\n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines use it for web page ranking [5] apparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths** \n",
    "\n",
    "+ GBDT does not require you to figure out non-linear feature interactions [5, 7 min in].\n",
    "+ You can inspect how a GBDT work better than you can with ANN [5, 8 min in and 28 min in]\n",
    "+ GBDT can function well without feature normalization [5, 7 min in]\n",
    "+ Can support different loss functions [5, 7 min in], but I don't yet understand the power that this entails.\n",
    "+ It can be utilized in conjuction with various models, not only decision trees even though DT is the norm [1].\n",
    "+ Reduces overfitting issues. In the case of using decision trees, one might greatly overfit the training data since it makes firm decision boundaries, gradient boosting weights together many decision trees making these boundaries fuzzier [2].\n",
    "+ Empirically found to be a compete well against other algorithm for general problems in Kaggle competitions [2].\n",
    "+ Better performance on GBDT than RF [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GBDT requires careful tuning of parameters [5, 7 min in]\n",
    "- GBDT are often computationally more expensive than RF [3].\n",
    "- GBDT cannot extrapolate, in other words: GBDT cannot draw conclusions outside the training data, only in between it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "I currently understand it as GBDT can't extrapolate from, so if that is required, do not choose GBDT. Other than that, GBDT seems to be a good all round model that is beaten mainly by techniques niched for certain use cases.\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "\n",
    "Have you played the game 20 questions? In that game, you should ask some number of yes or no questions in order to figure out whom someone is thinking of. If you do it well, you probably won't start with too specific questions, but instead go for general questions like \"is it a male or female?\". This is how a *decision tree* (DT) works.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could make a model that actually asks 20 questions, but my chosen model (GBC) is instead combining hundreds of simpler decision trees that only ask about four questions. My model will first try to do its best using only one DT, then it will try let another DT weigh in, but this DT has been trained to do well on guessing on things that the previous DTs did bad. It will be as if you have a boss that is corrected by an advisor, both of whom in turn are corrected by another advisor, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the final model functions like a line of advisors standing in a line, where the formost persons voice will be strongest, but all voices are still heard. Also, since every person in the line is trained to know and care more or less about various details that the people ahead needed help with, the combination of their opinions will represent a set of ideas rather than a single experts photographic knowledge of something. This makes the final model generalize to new data!"

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "The score in our grid search was cross validated using partitions of the training data, so by chance, the best candidate presented from a grid search could have a lower F-score than the default parameterisation on the testing data. This was something I concluded when a grid search on a subset of a larger *param_grid* found better result than the grid search on the full *param_grid* (Optim. 4 used a *learning_rate* of 0.075 and got better results on the test set, while Optim. 6 had a *learning_rate* of 0.075 in it's *param_grid*, a *learning_rate* of 0.08 was chosen as the optimal, but ended up with a lower test score).\n",

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If the models training time were relevant to consider, I would certainly evaluate if the drop in F-score of about 7% justified it. Perhaps we should had used an unoptimized model in order to determine the most important features first, and then during the optimization process evaluated how many features we wanted to include based on the training time we found plausible.\n",

    "For this very case, I believe that the training data will be representative even in a year or two, and this tells me we won't need to retrain it with new data often. With that said, I figure the additional time in this case, was worth in order to get a slightly higher F-score.\n",

Will the F-score improve, holding the training time fixed? The F-score dropped from about 0.75 to 0.70 with the reduced feature set, and the time reduction was 90%, how much better will the F-score become with a higher number of *n_estimators*?\n",
